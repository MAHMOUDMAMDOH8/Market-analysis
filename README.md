The goal of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive data solution using SQL Server, SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services), and Power BI. The project aims to create a Data Warehouse (DW) and utilize Power BI for data visualization and reporting.

Key Components:

SQL Server: The project will leverage the power and reliability of SQL Server as the database management system. SQL Server provides a robust platform for storing and managing large volumes of data efficiently. It offers various features like high availability, security, and scalability.

SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services): SSIS will be utilized to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various data sources into the Data Warehouse. SSIS provides a visual development environment for building ETL processes and offers a wide range of transformations and connectivity options to handle diverse data sources.

Data Warehouse (DW): The project will involve designing and implementing a Data Warehouse to provide a unified, integrated, and optimized repository of data for analysis and reporting. The DW will be designed to support efficient querying and reporting by organizing data into a dimensional model such as star or snowflake schema.

Power BI: Power BI will be employed as the primary tool for data visualization, interactive dashboards, and reporting
